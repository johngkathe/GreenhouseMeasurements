# GreenhouseMeasurements

This is a project I started to update my portfolio as well as help my dad prepare for running the greenhouse we're building.

For those of you interested in the coding structure of this program, it is built in JavaScript using MEAN frameworks.  Initially this will be MongoDB, Express, and Node for the back end, although I hope to add a front end with Angular when I add Angular to my toolbox.
